   Add routing to the weather app using AngularJS' ngRoute Module

   a) Create the main index.html route handler which should have
      all the AngularJS code, Routes, Controllers, Bootstrap and CSS.
  
   b) Create the HTML for the home view under /views/home.html. This
      view will just have a single link to the weather app. The links
      URL should be "#!/weather".
   
   c) Move the HTML for the weather app under the path /views/weather.html
  
   d) Set up a route called /weather/:zip? that will load the weather.html
      view AND automatically display the weather data without having the enter
      the ZIP code IF the zip code is passed into the URL. The ZIP code will
      be obtained from the route URL using the $routeParams service.
